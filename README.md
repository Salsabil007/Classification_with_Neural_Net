# Classification_with_Neural_Net
The three assignments are part of a course.                                                                                                                 
Part_1:
It is a simple logistic regression classifier to classify cats vs non-cats images. The test accuracy of the model is 68%. Maybe some overfitting is happening.

Part_2:
It is a binary classification neural network with a single hidden layer and a non-linear activation function. As the flower dataset is not linearly separable, logistic regression did really bad performance with only 47% accuracy. However, using the new one hidden layer neural network, the accuracy reached 90%.Maybe increasing the size of hidden layer would improve the accuracy.
Part_3:
This is model where I have implemented a 2-layer and an 4-layer neural network and used the same dataset as Part_1. The 2-layer neural network performs with 72% accuracy which is higher that the logistic regression's accuracy. However, the 4-layer model performs even better than the 2 -layer model with an accuracy of 80%.
